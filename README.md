# Within The Dark

This repository contains the Python/Pygame prototype for **Within The Dark**, a 2D pixelated side-scroller. The project focuses on horror themed combat and exploration.

This demo features:

- A player character with dashing, blocking and attack mechanics.
- A spectral companion named Dread with multiple cooldown-based abilities.
- Several enemy types including the boss *Crypt Guardian*.
- Simple tile-based levels and side-scrolling camera.

The goal is to expand the prototype into the complete "Awakening" prologue chapter. See `Prologue Finalization Checklist.txt` for remaining tasks.
